# Quality Assurance Test Suite: "The Internet" (HerokuApp)

A QA portfolio project demonstrating the application of international testing standards (**ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119**) and **ISTQB** methodologies on a web environment.

## Project Overview
This project serves as a comprehensive validation of "The Internet" by Heroku, a playground designed for testing difficult web interactions.

## Key Artifacts
